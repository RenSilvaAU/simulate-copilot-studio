    "# Banking Chatbot Simulator\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the use of a banking chatbot simulator. The notebook is designed to simulate interactions with a banking chatbot to resolve various banking-related queries. The main components of the notebook include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CopilotStudioBot Class**: This class handles the interaction with the chatbot, including starting a conversation, sending questions, and receiving responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **UserSimulator Class**: This class simulates a user interacting with the chatbot. It uses the Azure OpenAI service to generate the next question to ask the chatbot based on the chatbot's response.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Environment Setup**: The notebook uses environment variables to configure the bot name and environment name. These variables are used to initialize the `CopilotStudioBot` and `UserSimulator` classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Conversation Simulation**: The notebook contains several cells that simulate conversations with the chatbot. Each cell demonstrates a different query being asked to the chatbot and the response received.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BOT_NAME**: The name of the chatbot.\n",
    "- **ENV_NAME**: The environment name where the chatbot is hosted.\n",
    "- **PROMPT**: The initial prompt provided to the Azure OpenAI service to guide the conversation.\n",
    "- **client**: An instance of the Azure OpenAI client used to generate the next question.\n",
    "- **result**: The result of the conversation simulation, indicating whether the conversation was successful or if it required escalation to a human.\n",
    "- **simulator**: An instance of the `UserSimulator` class used to simulate the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this notebook, simply run each cell in sequence. The notebook will simulate interactions with the banking chatbot and display the results of each conversation. The conversations are designed to stop as soon as the initial question is answered or if the user needs to speak to a human."
